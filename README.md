# Kotlin API App

This project is a Kotlin-based app that integrates an external API using the **MVVM** architecture pattern. It demonstrates how to manage API calls efficiently with **Coroutines** and handle the data using the **MVVM** architecture. The app fetches data from a REST API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## About the App

The **Kotlin API App** fetches data from a public API and displays it in the app. The app leverages **MVVM** architecture to manage the UI and business logic, and it makes use of **Coroutines** for handling asynchronous API calls.

Key features include:
- **MVVM Architecture**: Efficient separation of concerns for better code management and scalability.
- **API Call**: Fetching data from a remote API.
- **Coroutines**: Handling asynchronous operations like network calls in a more efficient and readable way.
- **LiveData**: Observing data changes and updating the UI accordingly.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the MVVM pattern to separate UI logic from business logic.
- **API Call**: The app makes HTTP requests to an external API to fetch data asynchronously.
- **Coroutines**: Efficiently handles background tasks like API calls without blocking the UI thread.
- **LiveData**: Automatically updates the UI when new data is fetched from the API.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed API calls or network issues.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Kotlin**: The programming language for Android development.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Architecture pattern to manage UI and business logic.
- **Coroutines**: A Kotlin feature for managing background threads and performing asynchronous tasks in a simple and efficient way.
- **LiveData**: Lifecycle-aware data holder for observing changes and automatically updating the UI.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for making API calls.
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development.

## Project Workflow

- **Day 1**: Set up the basic MVVM architecture and prepare for API integration.
- **Day 2**: Implement API call functionality using Retrofit and Coroutines.
- **Day 3**: Integrate LiveData for observing API call results and updating the UI.
- **Day 4**: Handle errors for failed API calls or network issues.
- **Day 5**: Finalize the UI and enhance app functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarsNicodemus/Kotlin-api-app.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build the app and run it on an emulator or physical device.

### Usage
The app will fetch data from an external API and display it on the main screen.
If the API call succeeds, the data is displayed in the UI. If it fails, an error message will be shown.
The data is managed through LiveData and updated in real-time based on API responses.
